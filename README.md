## General Info

- I did this project to learn Material UI better, so I tried to use many components.
- I fetched the content (like posts, users, etc.) from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
- I used [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for state management.
- I added ligth/dark mode via [`CssBaseline`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-css-baseline).
- Since this is a simple project, that is all. :))
